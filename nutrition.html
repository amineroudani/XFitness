            We know that weight manipulation, whether it be weight loss or 
            weight gain, can be a very taboo topic. We also know that the word “diet”  
            strikes fear in many as you can see from the “fuck diet culture” stickers posted 
            around Batiment 103. Unfortunately, there is a gross misconception about 
            what “diet” and weight loss/gain is, but we're just here to explain these 
            concepts as simply as possible. We're not here to tell you to lose or gain 
            weight. We're just here to give you all the tools you may need to commit 
            to any changes you may choose to go through with as healthily as you can.
        </div>
        <h3>A diet.</h3>
        <div class="basic-text">
            The term “diet” has for a long time been associated with unhealthy practices. 
            People think that once they're on a “diet”, it's suddenly time to stop eating 
            and stove or all they're allowed to eat during the day is 2 rice crackers and 
            they need to fast 20 hours a day and cut all food groups out and not eat any 
            of the food they enjoy.  
            <br>
            No. Stop.
            <br>
            The definitions of “diet” as by Merriam-Webster is “food and drink 
            regularly provided or consumed”. A diet is just what we eat and drink on 
            a regular basis, there is nothing wrong with a “diet” per se, only the unhealthy, 
            brutal connotation it is associated with.
            <br>
            We prefer to call it a <b>lifestyle</b>. 
            <br>
            You need to stop thinking of a “diet” as a <b>short term</b> strategy of starving
            yourself for 4 weeks and hoping to achieve your goals. These things take time 
            and you need to approach it responsibly for your own safety and to guarantee 
            your success. Very often people brutally cut 5 or more kilos in the span of 
            a month, but immediately rebound because of how <b>unsustainable</b> their diet 
            is.
            <br>
            When approaching a weight altering plan, we need to think of what <b>you</b>  
            can <b>easly</b> live with <b>1-10 years</b> down the road.
            <br>
            But you may be thinking, what is my first step to building my own 
            healthy and approachable diet plan?
            <br>
            First, you need to understand that the ONLY way to lose / gain weight is through 
            your calorie intake vs your calorie expenditure. 
            Of course, not all calories are the same, .... comes down to the same thing.

        </div>
        <h3>Calories in vs Calories out</h3>
        <div class="basic-text">
            We see too many excuses out there talking about “slow / fast metabolism” 
            or other reasons relating to one's condition as to why they can’t achieve 
            their goals. Although metabolism does have an impact, this doesn’t prevent 
            you from achieving anything, and is only something you may have to work around.

            At the end of the day, the second law of thermodynamics is a fundamental law 
            that every person has to accept.  

        </div>
        <h3>Calorie calculator</h3>
        <div class="basic-text">
            The first step to building your own plan is to find out your maintenance 
            calories. Your maintenance calories is how much energy you burn daily through 
            your bodily functions and activity level. Using   
            <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/maintenance-calorie">this link</a> 
            you can access one. These will never be 100% accurate but they provide an 
            important ballpark on how many calories you burn every day.
            <br>
            The idea is simple, if you eat your maintenance calories every day, you will 
            stay at the exact same weight, if you eat below, you'll lose weight, if you 
            eat above you'll gain weight.
